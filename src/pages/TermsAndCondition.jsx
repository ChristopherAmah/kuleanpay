          Description of the Service
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The Service is an Internet-based transaction management and escrow-like service provided by Kuleanpay through its Platform under the terms of this Agreement. <br /><br />

          We enable you to make or receive immediate or future Payments to or from others (a Payment Transaction). In order to enable you to make a Payment Transaction, we will set up and maintain a payment account for you (we will call this 'your account'). Once we have set up your account, you can ask us to make a payment transaction to another person (a payment recipient) by paying the amount you want to pay to a payment recipient into your payment account and providing us with an instruction on when; or, upon satisfaction of what conditions, you wish us to release funds to that payment recipient. <br /><br />

          Our Escrow Services enable you and other Kuleanpay Users to pay funds to us to be held in Escrow in respect of arrangements between you and the other Kuleanpay Users to make a payment or payments to other Kuleanpay Users. Such funds will be paid to us as your, and the other Kuleanpay Users', Escrow Agent, and Kuleanpay will hold such funds in trust to be dealt with in accordance with these Escrow Terms. <br /><br />

          When both you and the other Kuleanpay Users who have funded the Escrow are agreed that the arrangement in respect of which we hold funds in Escrow has been completed, we will pay out the sums that we hold in Escrow to the specified Kuleanpay User(s) in accordance with a Release Notice as provided in the Escrow Release section of these Escrow Terms. <br />

  Setting up the Escrow
</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  When setting up an Escrow with other Kuleanpay Users, you:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
  <li>
    Shall ensure you have given to us the details of all of the other Escrow
    participants who are already or are to sign up and become Kuleanpay Users
    in accordance with the Kuleanpay Terms and Conditions, comprising their
    full name, email address and/or mobile phone number (Escrow Participants);
  </li>
  <li>
    Will specify the amount(s) that is to be held in Escrow (Escrow Funds) and
    the amounts to be funded by funding the Escrow Participant(s);
  </li>
  <li>
    Will specify the intended recipient(s) of the Escrow Funds and the amounts
    to be paid to them (if known);
  </li>
  <li>
    Shall specify the duration of the Escrow (being a period of not more than
    12 calendar months) and the date on which the Escrow shall come to an end,
    which shall be referred to in these Escrow Terms as the long-stop date;
  </li>
  <li>
    Irrevocably authorise and unconditionally instruct us (jointly with the
    other Escrow Participants who will fund the Escrow) to act as your trustee
    and Escrow Agent in relation to the Escrow Funds;
  </li>
  <li>
    Irrevocably agree and unconditionally instruct Kuleanpay to pay out the
    Funds to the Escrow Participants specified to receive the funds in the
    Escrow Release form.
  </li>
</ul>
<p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
  Once you have provided all the relevant information set out above (Escrow
  Information), we shall contact the other Escrow Participants and obtain their
  confirmation that they wish to jointly instruct us with you on the same basis
  as the Escrow Information provided and we will ensure that they are, or will
  become, Kuleanpay Users. If the other Escrow Participants do not become
  Kuleanpay Users, we will not proceed with the Escrow.
</p>


<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
  Funding the Escrow
</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  Once we have received confirmation from all the Escrow Participants, in
  accordance with the setting up of the Escrow Account, we will accept our
  appointment by each of the Escrow Participants as your Escrow Agent on the
  basis of these Escrow Terms and the Escrow Information.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  Each of the Kuleanpay Users who will be funding the Escrow shall arrange to
  make a payment to us using the Kuleanpay Account. This means that you will set
  up a payment order to us through your Account to make an immediate or
  future-dated payment to us of an amount equal to your share of the transaction
  arrangement from your account. We will then hold the Fund as your Escrow Agent
  and we shall hold them in Escrow in accordance with the Escrow Agent section
  of these Terms.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  The instruction to make payment to us of your share of the Escrow Funds is a
  payment order and it can only be revoked or changed in accordance with the
  provisions of these Terms. Once we have received your share of the Escrow
  Funds, your ability to change or revoke an Escrow Release will be subject to
  the Escrow Release section of these Terms.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  If we do not receive all the Escrow Funds from all the relevant Escrow
  Participants by the long-stop date, we shall return all the Escrow Funds we
  hold at that time to the Escrow Participants who funded them (to the same
  source as the Funds were received from).
</p>

<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
  Escrow Agent

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  Once all the Escrow Funds have been paid to us by each of the funding Escrow
  Participants:
</p>

<ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
  <li>We shall hold the Escrow Funds in Escrow;</li>
  <li>
    The Escrow Funds will be held in a Kuleanpay payment account which will be a
    separate and segregated account with a bank that satisfies the standards
    that would be required for a bank account holding payment funds under the
    relevant regulation;
  </li>
  <li>
    We will only deal with the Escrow Funds in accordance with the Escrow
    Release section of these Terms;
  </li>
  <li>
    If there are any conflicting notices, claims, demands or instructions given
    by any of the Escrow Participants in relation to any part of the Escrow
    Funds, we shall not take any action in relation to the Escrow Funds until we
    have received clear instructions from all the Escrow Participants or a final
    order from a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction directs us;
  </li>
  <li>
    Agree that we will have no legal, beneficial or other interest in the Escrow
    Funds, save as set out in these Terms.
  </li>
</ul>

<p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-4">
  The Escrow Participants unconditionally agree that any interest accrued or
  earned in relation to holding any of the Escrow Funds shall be held to the
  benefit of Kuleanpay.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  We may at any time reduce the long-stop date where we believe the arrangement
  to which the Escrow relates carries a particular risk to Kuleanpay as Escrow
  Agent as detailed below in the When we may refuse to act as Escrow Agent
  section of these Terms.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700">
  We may also, in our absolute discretion, increase the long-stop date upon the
  request and the agreement of all of the Escrow Participants.
</p>


<h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
  Escrow Release
</h2>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  We will hold Escrow Funds in Escrow for all the Escrow Participants until we
  have either: received a valid notice from all of the Escrow Participants to
  release the Escrow Funds (a Release Notice); or, the specified long-step date
  for the Escrow has passed with no valid Release Notice having been provided.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  A Release Notice shall authorise the release of the Escrow Funds by each of
  the Escrow Participants in accordance with the Escrow instructions and/or any
  additional instruction contained within the Release Notice and shall be made
  by each of the Escrow Participants by either:
</p>

<ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
  <li>
    Completing and sending to us an escrow release instruction form in the form
    set out in the Kuleanpay escrow appointment form (Escrow Instruction Form),
    which is available upon request from Kuleanpay; or
  </li>
  <li>
    Authorising the release of the Escrow Funds via our phone application or
    online secure customer portal.
  </li>
</ul>

<p className="text-gray-700 mt-4 mb-4">
  The duly and properly completed Release Notices from all of the Escrow
  Participants shall constitute an irrevocable instruction to us to make the
  payment(s) from the Escrow Funds to the specified recipients in accordance
  with the Escrow Instructions and/or any additional instruction contained
  within the Release Notice.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  We shall then make payments from the Escrow Funds to the nominated account of
  the Kuleanpay User who is specified to receive Escrow Funds in the same way as
  Kuleanpay would make payment from your account under the Kuleanpay Payment
  Services Terms.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
  If there is any balance of Escrow Funds after we have made all payments in
  accordance with the Release Notice, the balance shall be returned to the
  Escrow Participants in the proportions they funded the Escrow Funds in the
  same way as we would return funds to a Kuleanpay User under the Kuleanpay
  Payment Services Terms i.e. to the same source as the funds were received
  from.
</p>

<p className="text-gray-700">
  If we do not receive a duly completed Release Notices from all the Escrow
  Participants as specified above by the specified long-stop date, and no valid
  request has been received to extend the long-stop date – to which we have
  agreed – we shall return all the Escrow Funds we hold to the Escrow
  Participants who funded them, in the same way as we would return funds to a
  Kuleanpay User under the Kuleanpay Payment Services Terms, i.e. to the same
  source as the funds were received from.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-8">Obligations of Sellers</h2>

      <p className="mb-3">
        On the Transaction Detail Screens, the Seller to a Transaction must designate an Account to which payment for
        the Transaction will be made. The Seller in a Transaction shall deliver the items set forth in Transaction Detail
        Screens directly to the Buyer (or Buyers) at the address specified by such Buyer as shown on the Kuleanpay website
        and these Terms.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        The Seller shall use a delivery service that confirms delivery and the Seller shall provide Kuleanpay with a
        tracking or reference number for the shipment of the goods. The Seller gives Kuleanpay permission to act as its
        agent in communicating with the shipping company regarding the notice of the delivery of the goods.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In the event Kuleanpay does not receive notice of shipment from Seller within 10 (ten) calendar days of
        notification from Kuleanpay notice to the Seller to ship the items, the Seller authorises Kuleanpay to return
        the escrowed funds (excluding Kuleanpay fees) to Buyer.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In the event of a return of the items by Buyer, Seller shall notify Kuleanpay of the receipt of the returned items.
        Upon receipt of such notice from Seller, the Seller's five (5) day inspection period shall commence.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In the event the Seller accepts the returned items within the inspection period or fails to act within the inspection
        period, Kuleanpay shall remit the escrowed Funds (excluding Kuleanpay fees) to the Buyer. If the Seller notifies
        Kuleanpay of its non-acceptance of any returned items within the Seller's inspection period, then Kuleanpay will
        retain the escrow funds pending dispute resolution or take other action as authorised.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary above, if all Users to a Transaction agree on the Transaction Detail Screens
        that there is no shipping required, then no party hereto will have any obligation under this Agreement with respect
        to shipping.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In the case the Transaction involved is that of a digital product or payment for a service, the Seller shall ensure
        that the product or service (the “Product”): is delivered within the agreed timeline; error-free; fully address each
        of the Buyer's defined requirements; are a complete set of the Product as agreed in the Buyer’s requirements; the
        Product is of a standard consistent with the level of expertise indicated in the Seller's profile and proposals.
        If the Buyer agrees on the Transaction Detail Screen to be satisfied with the Product, the Escrow Fund will be paid

        the purchase price and related fees (unless such fees are to be paid by the Seller) will be obtained for
        the deposit into escrow. Depending on the amount of the Transaction and the currency selected for the
        Transaction, the Buyer may remit the necessary funds via various methods, which may include corporate credit
        card, charge card, debit card or purchasing card, check (cheque), cashier's check, money order, ACH Debit or
        Wire Transfer. In the case of wire transfers, the Buyer will initiate the wire to an account designated by
        Kuleanpay on or before the date set forth in the Transaction Detail Screens.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Regardless of the payment method, Buyer authorises Kuleanpay and its authorised agents to initiate credit or
        debit transactions, as applicable, to obtain the purchase price and fees due for a Transaction and to initiate
        any debit or credit entries or reversals, as the case may be, as may be necessary to correct any error in a
        payment or transfer and to discharge Buyer's obligations under this Agreement.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Kuleanpay will deposit funds received from Buyer into an escrow trust account maintained by Kuleanpay (the
        "Escrow Account"). Unless otherwise requested, as specified in the following sentence, escrowed deposits do
        not earn interest for the Buyer or Seller. If you anticipate an extended closing of the Transaction, then you
        may request and approve an instruction to have Kuleanpay place the Buyer's funds into an interest-bearing
        account for the benefit of the Buyer or Seller. If interest is to accrue to the benefit of the Seller, then
        both the Buyer and Seller must request and approve the establishment of the interest-bearing account. If this
        request is made, then Kuleanpay will charge the account of the party to whom the interest accrues an additional
        nonrefundable service charge of N10,000, which must be paid in advance.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Buyer shall notify Kuleanpay of the receipt or non-receipt of the items on the date the merchandise is received
        or the Buyer Inspection Period is started. Buyer shall notify Kuleanpay of the Buyer's acceptance or rejection
        of the items before the Buyer's Inspection Period expires. Upon receipt of notice from Buyer that the items
        have been received and accepted, Kuleanpay shall transfer the payment amount (less any amount payable to
        Kuleanpay for Kuleanpay fees) to Seller's Account.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Transfer to a Seller generally will be initiated within the next business day from the day on which notice of
        acceptance of the items is received from the Buyer. If Buyer has not notified Kuleanpay of the non-receipt or
        rejection of the items during the Buyer's Inspection Period, then Buyer authorises Kuleanpay to remit the
        escrowed funds (excluding Kuleanpay fees) to the Seller. Buyer shall follow the procedures set forth on the Site
        in the event the items are rejected.
      </p>

      {/* --- Section 2: Our Responsibilities --- */}
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-8">Our Responsibilities</h2>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Kuleanpay is obligated to perform only those duties expressly described in this Agreement. Kuleanpay shall not
        be liable for any error in judgment, for any act taken or not taken, or for any mistake of fact or law, except
        for gross negligence or willful misconduct. Kuleanpay may rely upon any notice, demand, request, letter,
        certificate, agreement, or any other document which purports to have been transmitted or signed by or on behalf
        of a User indicated as the sender or signatory thereof and shall have no duty to make any inquiry or
        investigation.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        In the event that Kuleanpay is uncertain as to its duties or rights under this Agreement, receives any
        instruction, demand or notice from any User or financial institution which, in Kuleanpay's opinion, is in
        conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, or any dispute arises with respect to this Agreement or
        the Escrowed Funds, Kuleanpay may:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 mb-3">
        <li>
          (i) consult with counsel of our choice (including our own attorneys) and any actions taken or not taken based
          upon the advice of counsel shall be deemed consented to by you, or
        </li>
        <li>
          (ii) refrain from taking any action other than to retain the funds in escrow for delivery in accordance with
          the written agreement of the Users, the decision of a mediation panel pursuant to a mediation process commenced
          and conducted in accordance with the applicable rules or a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of
          competent jurisdiction, or
        </li>
        <li>
          (iii) discharge our duties under this Agreement by depositing all Funds by interpleader action with a court of
          competent jurisdiction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-3">
        Kuleanpay may, at any time, give notice of Kuleanpay's intent to resign as Escrow Agent. If within 10 (ten) days
        of such notice, Kuleanpay has not received notice from all Users in a Transaction that they have designated a
        substitute escrow agent (which notice shall identify the substitute escrow agent), Kuleanpay may discharge
        Kuleanpay duties under this Agreement by depositing all escrowed Funds with a court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-3">
        If an alternate Escrow Agent is so designated, Kuleanpay shall be discharged from Kuleanpay duties under this
        Agreement by delivering all escrowed funds to such person or entity. Upon payment of the escrow funds pursuant
        to this Agreement, Kuleanpay shall be fully released from any and all liability and obligations with respect to
        the escrow funds and the Transaction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Cancelling a Transaction</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If a Transaction cannot be completed for any reason, including
        cancellation by Kuleanpay for any reason, Kuleanpay will notify each
        User in such Transaction by e-mail to the e-mail address each has
        provided to Kuleanpay. In Kuleanpay's sole discretion, Kuleanpay may
        cancel any Transaction if each User to a Transaction fails to agree on
        the terms as required in the Transaction Details Screens by clicking the
        "Agree" button as requested on the Site. You may cancel a Transaction as
        provided in this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Questions about the Services</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You may inquire about payments made through the Service by calling the
        number on the Site or by filling out the customer service form. If you
        believe an error has been made or there has been any unauthorised use of
        your Account or the Services, you agree to call or send an e-mail as
        soon as possible but no later than forty-eight hours after you became
        aware of an error. When you contact Kuleanpay, please be prepared to
        provide your name, Kuleanpay reference number and the email address you
        have registered on the Kuleanpay site.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Statements, Verification</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You agree that all disclosures and communications regarding this
        Agreement and the Service shall be made by e-mail or on the Site unless
        the parties make other arrangements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Digital Identification</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You understand and agree that Kuleanpay will create, issue, and verify a
        digital identification (a "Digital ID") for each User. This Digital ID
        is attached to each accepted electronic document and notification
        e-mail. You agree that your Digital ID is a valid "Electronic
        Signature."
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Fees</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Unless otherwise agreed upon by each User in the Transaction, Buyer
        agrees to pay the fees for the Services that are disclosed on the Site
        at the time the completed Transaction Escrow instructions are agreed to
        by all such Users, as well as any other fees, including, without
        limitation, third party service fees (e.g., shipping, appraisal,
        inspection, etc.). Once paid, Kuleanpay fees are nonrefundable.
        Kuleanpay fees may change from time to time at Kuleanpay's absolute and
        sole discretion. Kuleanpay is not responsible for payment of any sales,
        use of personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed on
        any items purchased or sold through the Services or otherwise arising
        from the Transaction.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        If payment transactions happen that you did not authorise
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        We will normally be liable to you if we act on a payment order that you
        have not authorised or which you did authorise but which you cancelled
        within the timescale set out in "Your ability to cancel or change a
        payment order". In that case, we will repay you any funds taken from
        you, as a result of the payment being debited. You will have to cover
        100% of your losses if this has resulted from your login details being
        compromised.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        There are some circumstances in which you will not have to cover 100% of
        your losses. This is when:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          Your login details came into the hands of the unauthorised User as a
          result of something done by our employees or agents;
        </li>
        <li>
          The losses have occurred after you notified us about the potential
          compromise of your login details or we did not provide a means of you
          notifying us;
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        If there is an error in carrying out a payment order
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        All Kuleanpay Users are responsible for providing us with the correct
        nominated account information. If you are the payment recipient and you
        have given incorrect nominated account information or have failed to
        update the information, then the Kuleanpay User making the payment will
        be considered to have made a valid payment to you and we will have no
        liability to you if you are unable to recover the funds.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If we fail to make a payment we should have done or if we make a payment
        into a nominated account of a payment recipient and the account details
        we paid to are incorrect, if we make a mistake, as soon as we can, we
        will refund you the amount of the transaction into your account and if
        you do not want us to re-execute the payment transaction, or we are
        unable to do so, we will refund you the amount into your nominated
        account or your funding account as we agree with you. If you have to pay
        any charges or interest as a result of this happening, we will refund
        those too.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If you made a mistake, for example, you give us incorrect details for
        the payment recipient, you set the wrong date for payment, or ask us to
        make a payment for the wrong amount, we will not be liable to you if you
        suffer a loss as a result of that or if you lose the funds.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If we are late in paying the payment recipient, we will also be liable
        to you if you suffer any losses as a result, but we can ask the bank of
        the payment recipient to treat the payment as having been made on time.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        If anything else goes wrong with a payment, but we can show that we were
        not responsible and we made the payment to the payment recipient's bank
        as we agreed with you, the other bank will be liable for this and not
        us.
      </p>

      <p>
        If funds are paid to the wrong person or are lost, even if we are not at
        fault, we will make reasonable efforts to recover the funds or trace
        them and if you write to us to ask for them, we can provide you with the
        information we have about the outcome of our efforts, including the
        details of the person who did receive the funds if we have them.
      </p>


      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Security</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Kuleanpay uses a Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), a security protocol that
        provides data encryption, server authentication, and message integrity
        for connections to the Internet to ensure that the data you provide
        Kuleanpay is not transmitted over the Internet unencrypted and cannot be
        viewed by unauthorised individuals. Kuleanpay has also implemented a
        security system requiring a User ID and a password to access your
        transactions on the Site. You agree not to give your password to any
        other person or entity and to protect it from being used or discovered
        by anyone else.

        services prior to entering into a legally binding agreement with them

        account unless you have told us about it before the losses happen.

        to you for any of your losses.

        Where we are liable, we will pay you back as soon as we can and no later

        making payment to you.
